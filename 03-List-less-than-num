# Take a list, say for example this one:
# a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
# and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list
# that are less than 5.

# Extras:
# 1-Instead of printing the elements one by one, make a new list that has all
# the elements less than 5 from this list in it and print out this new list.
# 2-Write this in one line of Python.
# 3-Ask the user for a number and return a list that contains only elements
# from the original list a that are smaller than that number given by the user.

a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
# 1-first trial below
# b = []
# for i in a:
#    if i < 5:
#        b.append(i)
# print(b)

# 2-shortening the code and using list comprehension
# b = [i for i in a if i < 5]
# print(b)

# 3-final
num = int(input("limit number below which numbers in list will be printed: "))
b = [i for i in a if i < num]
print(b)

# Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd,
# print out an appropriate message to the user.

# Extras:
# 1 - If the number is a multiple of 4, print out a different message.
# 2 - Ask the user for two numbers: one number to check (call it num)
# and one number to divide by (check). If check divides evenly into num,
# tell that to the user. If not, print a different appropriate message.

    print(str(num)+" is an even number")
else:
    print(str(num)+" is an odd number")
# Extras

    print(str(num)+" is perfectly divisible by " + str(check))
